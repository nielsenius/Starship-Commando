About the game:

Starship Commando is a side-scrolling space-shooter. The objective is to destroy enemy ships and collect shield upgrades as you fly your way to the enemy mothership (boss).

You may select one of three difficulty settings: easy, medium, or hard. As the difficulty goes up, you receive fewer lives, more enemies spawn, they shoot more lasers, and the terrain gets more difficult to navigate.

Control your ship using the arrow keys and shoot lasers using the space bar. Pause the game by pressing “p” and quit the game by pressing “q”. 

If your starship is shot by an enemy laser and you have no shields, you lose a life. If you hit anything, you lose a life.

High scores are recorded when the player dies or beats the game.
